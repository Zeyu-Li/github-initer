# GitHub Initializer

Initializes a GitHub ready repo folder with an MIT license and a README with the title given. 

## Usage

Simply run `create.ps1` and it will prompt you for the repo name. This name can include spaces but in the end the folder name will be in all lowercased and spaces will be replaces with dashes. For example if you enter in `Some New RePo` the folder will be called `some-new-repo` but the readme title will still be `Some New RePo`
